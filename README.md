# AiR-Dx: Artificial Intelligence for Radar Detection Experiment  

**AiR-Dx** is a lightweight, noise-resilient convolutional neural network (CNN) framework for classifying radar Doppler spectrograms of airborne objects such as:
- 🐦 Bird Flocks
- ✈️ Drone Swarms
- 🛸 Stealth UAVs

This project aims to deliver high-accuracy classification under varying noise levels while being compact enough for potential edge or FPGA deployment.
